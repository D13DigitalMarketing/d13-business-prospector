## Test Coverage Goal
<!-- What needs test coverage -->

## Current Coverage Status
<!-- Paste coverage report or describe current state -->

```
File               | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines
-------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------
src/core/module.ts |   45.2  |   30.0   |   60.0  |   45.2
```

## Missing Test Scenarios
<!-- List specific scenarios that need tests -->

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] **Happy path test**: Description
- [ ] **Error handling test**: Description
- [ ] **Edge case test**: Description
- [ ] **Input validation test**: Description

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] **End-to-end workflow test**: Description
- [ ] **API integration test**: Description
- [ ] **CLI command test**: Description

### Mock Requirements
<!-- What external dependencies need mocking -->

- [ ] HTTP requests to [service]
- [ ] File system operations
- [ ] Database connections
- [ ] Third-party APIs

## Test Data Requirements
<!-- What test fixtures/data are needed -->

```typescript
// Example test data structure
const mockBusinessData = {
  name: "Test Business",
  // ... other properties
};
```

## Expected Outcomes
- [ ] Increase coverage to minimum 80%
- [ ] All critical paths have 100% coverage
- [ ] Edge cases are properly tested
- [ ] Error conditions are validated

## Testing Tools Used
- [ ] Vitest for unit tests
- [ ] MSW for API mocking
- [ ] Test fixtures for data
- [ ] Custom test helpers

## Complexity Estimate
<!-- How much effort is this? -->
- [ ] Small (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Medium (half day)
- [ ] Large (full day+)
